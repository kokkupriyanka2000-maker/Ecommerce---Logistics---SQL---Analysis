# E-Commerce Logistics & Delivery Analysis using SQL

## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce delivery and logistics data using SQL.
The objective is to understand factors affecting late deliveries and evaluate
logistics performance across shipping modes, warehouses, discounts, and product importance.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Public Dataset)
- Format: CSV file
- Description: The dataset contains information related to customer shipping,
  warehouse blocks, shipping modes, discounts, product importance, and delivery status.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- MySQL
- SQL
- GitHub

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
The following analyses were performed using SQL queries:
- Total number of orders
- Late delivery percentage
- Shipping mode vs late delivery analysis
- Warehouse-wise delivery performance
- Discount impact on late deliveries
- Product importance vs delivery delay

## 📊 Key Insights
- Certain shipping modes experienced higher late delivery rates
- Specific warehouse blocks contributed more to delivery delays
- Higher discounts showed correlation with increased late deliveries
- High-importance products require better logistics prioritization

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
Initially, NULL values appeared after importing the CSV file into MySQL due to
column mapping mismatch. This issue was identified using validation queries and
resolved by re-importing the dataset with correct schema alignment.

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze logistics and delivery
performance in e-commerce operations. The insights derived can help businesses
optimize shipping strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
